# Payment Link

A payment link is a reusable URL directing customers to a pre-arranged payment page. This link can be shared and repeatedly used.

When a customer uses a payment link, it initiates a new checkout session, displaying the payment interface. You can monitor payments via payment links using checkout session events.
