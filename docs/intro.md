# API Documentation

This documentation provides detailed information on how to use Payfect API to process and manage cryptocurrency payments. Like Stripe for cryptocurrency, our API provides a simple, seamless interface for businesses to handle their digital asset transactions.

## API Reference

Our API is based on REST principles. It accepts `Content-Type: application/json` request body, returns `Content-Type: application/json` response, and uses standard HTTP protocols and error codes.
